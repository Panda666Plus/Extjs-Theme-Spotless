# Extjs-Theme-Spotless
Extjs-Theme-Spotless from Ext.NET

## Usage

Just bring in CSS and js files

## Note

This is a semi-finished product. The image file needs to be renamed.
Change the image file name prefix under the image and resource folders to a folder, and then put the image in.
It's okay if you don't understand. You'll know it when you use it yourself. The console will indicate that the image file is missing. Just change the image file name according to the path.

Remember to submit it to me when you have revised it.

Give roses with a lingering fragrance in your hands.



## 使用方法

把css和js文件引入就行了



## 注意

这是一个半成品。图片文件需要重命名一下。
把image、resource文件夹下的图片文件名前缀改为文件夹然后把图片放进去。
看不懂没关系。自己用的时候就知道了。console会提示缺少图片文件。照着路径改图片文件名就行了。

修改好了记得提交给我一下。

赠人玫瑰，手有余香。
